# Call for Posters
APSys2016 seeks proposals for posters (demos are also welcome) describing novel work in any area of
interest to a broad systems audience. The posters will be presented during an
evening reception at the workshop. The poster session is meant to introduce new

workshop attendees.

We highly encourage you to submit controversial works, crazy ideas,
thought-provoking and innovative perspectives in designing and implementing
novel computer systems.

Session2 and Session3.
