APSys is a vibrant forum for systems researchers and practitioners across the world to meet, interact, and collaborate with their peers from the Asia/Pacific region. APSys 2016 hopes to build upon the success of previous APSys conferences, and put together a set of quality papers in computer systems. We solicit papers in the broad areas of computer systems, including (but not limited to) the following topics:

* Operating systems, their interaction with hardware architecture and programming languages, and vice versa
* Virtualization, including its novel applications
* File and storage systems
* Network systems including both wired and wireless networks
* Mobile, embedded and pervasive systems
* Cloud computing and data center management
* Systems for Big Data Analytics 
* Distributed systems
* Internet of Things
* System energy characterization and optimization 
* Testing and verification of computer systems
* Measurement, monitoring, and modeling
* Reliability, scalability, and fault tolerance
* Security and privacy
* Experience with deployed systems
* Application of interesting research ideas to computer systems, such as machine learning, stochastic modeling, new algorithms.

The workshop favors works with an experimental flavor such as measurement and prototyping.

# Submission Guidelines
Submissions should be six or fewer pages in length excluding references, formatted in standard ACM two-column conference style with 10-pt font size. Reviewing is single-blind, and the authors should have their names and affiliations in the first page of the paper. A submission may present preliminary results, propose a new research direction, provide insightful retrospective, or offer a provocative viewpoint on an important systems topic. Papers will be selected based on their likelihood of generating insightful technical discussions at the workshop and influencing future systems research. Relevant attributes include originality, technical merit, clarity, and technical relevance. Accepted papers will appear in the proceedings of the workshop, which will be published in the ACM Digital Library. Consistent with standard scholarly practice, the authors should not have substantially similar work in review anywhere else.

Submissions can be made online at [www.ap-sys.org](www.ap-sys.org) (the submission link will be operational near the deadline).
